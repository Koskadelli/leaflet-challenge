Module 15 Challenge

# Premise
This challenge involed creating Leaflet visualizations, utilizing Javascript, HTML, and CC to make interactive maps. The maps utilize data provided by The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short. In Leaflet part 1, you will see a visualization of Earthquakes recorded in the last week worldwide, whose markers vary based on their location, magnitude, and depth. In part 2, I've added a toggle to also see tectonic plate boundaires, and you can see substantially increased Earthquake volatility near them.
